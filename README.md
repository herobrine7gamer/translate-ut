## Features:
 - Convergence: It looks good on all screens.
 - Native UI: This isn't a crappy web app! It means you get a fast, reliable, and consistent experience.
 - Anonymization: It uses [Lingva Translate API](https://github.com/TheDavidDelta/lingva-translate), so you get Google Translate results with a degree of privacy
